/* for Loops


Youâ€™re making a shopping cart program.

The shopping cart is declared as a list of prices, and you need to add functionality to apply a discount and output the total price.

Take the discount percentage as input, calculate and output the total price for the shopping cart.
Use a for loop to iterate over the list.
Use the following formula to calculate the result of X% discount on $Y price: Y - (Y*X/100) */

cart = [15, 42, 120, 9, 5, 380]
discount = int(input())
total = 0

for x in cart:
  if (x - (x*discount/100)):
    total=x+ x
    break
