You are making a ticketing system.
The price of a single ticket is $100.
For children under 3 years old, the ticket is free.

Your program needs to take the ages of 5 passengers as input and output the total price for their tickets.

Sample Input
18
24
2
5
42

Sample Output
400
There is one child under 3 among the passengers, so the total price of 5 tickets will be $400. */

price = 100
total = 0
for i in range(5):
    age = int(input())
    if age > 3:
        total += price
    elif age <= 3:
        continue
print(total)
