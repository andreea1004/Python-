/* List Slices


Reversing a string is a common task during coding interviews.

Given a string as input, output its reverse.

Sample Input
hello world

Sample Output
dlrow olleh
Remember, a string is a list of characters, and you can reverse a string the same way you would reverse a list. */


word=input("")
print(word[::-1])
